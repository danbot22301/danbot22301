While he may <i>look</i> barely senteint, there's actually a lot of thought that goes into being a bird! Where to sit, what to destroy, how far to distribute your food, whether you should actually eat any of it first.
All the calculations for these actions are carefully considered, and with the help of this webpage I hope to dive into some of the finer aspects of living like the screaming, flying, pooping ball of chaos that each of us should 
  aspire to be. As mentioned earlier, one of the <b>most important</b> aspects of being a bird in the home is knowing how to destroy anything being put near you, whether that be your cage, toys, or furniture in the vicinity.
  <a href="https://danbot22301.github.io/taro-destruction/"> Link to Destruction Info. </a> Another miportant aspect of live as an avian is nowing how to properly utilize noise, info about this can be found  <a href="https://danbot22301.github.io/taro-scream/"> here. </a>
  Once you've read these pages, you'll be able to not only convincingly live like a parakeet, but other animals as well, such as:
  <ul>
         <li>A macaw</li>
         <li>A cockatoo</li>
         <li>A conure</li>
         <li>A human infant</li>
      </ul>
